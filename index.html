                            <h3>Upgrade of control programme for the POSEIDON silicon irradiation facility</h3>
                            <p class="subtitle" style="text-align: left;">My internship started the 27th of February 2023 and ended the 26th of May 2023.
                                Before diving into the results of my internship, a short introduction about SCK CEN is in order. SCK CEN is a company
                                located in Mol that researches nuclear waste and is a global leader in nuclear research, services and education.
                                <br><br>
                                SCK CEN has an ICT-division that aims to improve work inside as well as outside the company.
                                As thousands of documents are present in this company that need to be stored,
                                Alexandria was developed which is a site that can hold all these documents.
                                It is due to people having trouble with finding and downloading these documents,
                                an application was created to streamline this process by letting the user choose a directory
                                and easily provide them with all the documents that accompany this directory.
                                This is called Critical Documents Synchronisation Tool or CDST.<br><br>

                                CDST had a few issues. Some of these were:

                            </p>

                                <ul >

                                </ul>
                            <p style="text-align: left;" class="subtitle">
                                These issues were the topic of my internship as it was my job to try and fix these.
                                <br><br>
                                This project consisted of multiple phases, the first of which was checking the old code. After this,
                                small bugs, such as changing the downloaded document’s name, were fixed. Then,
                                I changed the old code so that the documents get downloaded instead of copied.
                                Finally, I added some quality of life items such as alerting the user when an error occurred.

                                                    <h1>LDC Luysterbos Training</h1>
                                                    <p>On Wednesday the 20th of April 2022 I gave a training regarding smart-phones and social media to 8 elderly people for Professional Skills</p>
                                                    <p>LDC Luysterbos is a service center in Geel that helps elderly people and people who have financial issues.</p>
                                                    <p>I did this project with 2 others: Moussa Marmouch and James Ceesay.</p>
                                                    <br>
                                                    <h2>The preparation</h2>
                                                    <p>To start I asked one of my colleagues to send a mail to our contact (who was Irmgard Schelles) for information regarding a training session that they asked for. </p>
                                                    <p>My colleague James sent a mail to our contact, and she responded saying that it's good that we wanted to do this training session/info session and that we have to contact her colleague Ellen Lievens.</p>
                                                    <p>I sent a mail to Ellen, asking her what date and time she wanted us to do the  info session and if we could meet somewhere in advance to see what they expect from us.</p>
                                                    <p>She replied that she needed data so that she can publish when we were going to organize said session. She also said that on the 24th of May, around 13.30, she could meet us in advance.</p>
                                                    <p>The 24th of May rolled around, and we talked with Ellen about when we/they wanted the session to be. She said that we needed to send her information when we are available.</p>
                                                    <p>Later in the day I sent a mail to her saying that we could do it from the 4th of April until the 17th and only on Mondays (because none of us had a class then).</p>
                                                    <p>She said that it couldn't work during Easter, but that it can work on the 20th of April. She asked if that was OK with us. We said that it was fine.</p>
                                                    <p>After all the mails, my colleagues and I started our PowerPoint and figuring out what we are going to talk about.</p>
                                                    <p>We made our PowerPoint, and we were ready for the session.</p>
                                                    <br>
                                                    <h2>The info session</h2>
                                                    <p>The info session rolled around, and we arrived a bit earlier than we needed to (I arrived at 12.50 and James was already there, Moussa came a few minutes after I arrived).</p>
                                                    <p>We entered the service center and asked around for Ellen Lievens, but she wasn't in because her son was sick, so her colleague Martine Engelen showed us to the meeting room we were supposed to use.</p>
                                                    <p>After hooking one of our laptops to the screen in the meeting room, we were waiting for our course participants.</p>
                                                    <p>After some course participants arrived, they asked us if we could help them with some technical issues they were having with their smartphones.</p>
                                                    <p>Next we started our presentation with the intro and whatsapp. After we were done with whatsapp, we asked our participants if they have any questions or problems. We solved those problems.</p>
                                                    <p>After this, we talked about facebook and asked if our participants had any problems or questions regarding this topic.</p>
                                                    <p>Thereafter, we talked about smartphones and asked if anyone had any problems or questions.</p>
                                                    <p>We ended our presentation with some terminology of smartphones. And after that, we asked them to fill in some paperwork.</p>
                                                    <br>
                                                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                                                    <p>I have learned that elderly people are smarter than I expected.</p>
                                                    <p>Giving an info session was pretty fun, and I want to do it again.</p>

                                                    <p>During a project week of Requirements Analysis in 2020, I and my team had to work out how to improve how managers or workers can check their expense report using a website and PHP.</p>
                                                    <p>Our client was Christel Maes who gave Java and who retired at the end of the school year in 2021.</p>

                                                    <h2>The preparation</h2>
                                                    <p>To start, we (my colleagues and I), started to get to know each other.</p>
                                                    <p>After getting to know each other, we started reading some documentation of students who have already tried working out an analysis for the expense reports. In total, there were 3 documents.</p>
                                                    <p>After reading each document carefully, we looked at which one we would use for our project.</p>
                                                    <p>We chose a document and tried to make better use cases.</p>
                                                    <p>After thinking the use cases thoroughly, we worked out who what questions we were going to ask our client.</p>
                                                    <p>After working out what questions we were going to ask, we asked our questions and she gave some clear responses.</p>
                                                    <br>
                                                    <h2>The project itself</h2>
                                                    <p>The project started with figuring out who was going to look for what user-friendliness we would like to add and what MoSCoW (Must have, Should have, Could have and Would have) we would implement.</p>
                                                    <p>After figuring out who was going to do what, we worked out who was going to be our CRUD master (leader) and document management.</p>
                                                    <p>I ended up being the CRUD master.</p>
                                                    <p>After figuring out who was going to take what responsibility, we started on some finishing-touches in the analysis-document and work on our presentation for our client.</p>
                                                    <p>Finally, we presented our project.</p>
                                                    <br>
                                                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                                                    <p>I have learned that being a leader has a lot of responsibilities.</p>
                                                    <p>Working on projects is fun, but it can be a pain, which I am willing to endure.</p>

                                                    <p>This project and the project of Requirements Analysis are related in the sense that first you need to analyze a project to see what is possible and then make an application with the information using laravel (php).</p>
                                                    <p>This project started on the 15th of February 2021 until somewhere in June 2021.</p>
                                                    <p>Our client was a teacher</p>
                                                    <p>I was the leader of the group.</p>
                                                    <br>
                                                    <h2>The project</h2>
                                                    <p>During this project I showed my leadership skills at its fullest.</p>
                                                    <p>I brought our team closer together and I was good at assigning roles to colleagues.</p>
                                                    <p>We started the project in good mood.</p>
                                                    <p>Every 2 weeks our team came together to see what our progress was in that sprint</p>
                                                    <p>Sadly enough, a member of our group never turned up after the 4th week.</p>
                                                    <p>At the end we were ready to defend our project to the jury and most of us passed (including me).</p>
                                                    <br>
                                                    <p>A couple of days before the deadline, we had to test the sites of other groups with the same project.</p>
                                                    <p>One of those groups ended up hacking our site, which was quite chaotic.</p>
                                                    <br>
                                                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                                                    <p>I have learned that being a leader has a lot of responsibilities and that some choices are difficult.</p>
                                                    <p>Working with php can be a pain, but it was quite interesting.</p>
                                                    <p>It has also taught me that being a leader is more than having responsibilities, it's also to have fun with your team.</p>

                                                    <p>For Cordova I had the pleasure to work out a useful application for mobile users. I have chosen a GPS for in our school.</p>
                                                    <p>The project required us to make a mobile app with a plugin, local storage and data exchange with JSON.</p>
                                                    <br>
                                                    <h2>The project</h2>
                                                    <p>To start, I needed to think of a plugin to use for my application. I ended up picking the 'Dialogs' plugin</p>
                                                    <p>The dialogs-plugin relays a message to the user.</p>
                                                    <p>I used a weather API to show the weather.</p>
                                                    <p>I made sure that you can add some sort of note to let the application know where you need to be.</p>
                                                    <p>But due to some problems, I couldn't finished my project.</p>
                                                    <p>The biggest problem that I had, was that the GPS doesn't follow your device.</p>
                                                    <p>I did however make sure that the classes, toilets and coffee-rooms had a picture.</p>
                                                    <p>You can choose a location from a list and the GPS shows you where to go.</p>
                                                    <p>If you're chosen location is higher or lower than you, then the GPS guides you to the correct staircase.</p>

                                                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                                                    <p>I have learned that I have problems with procrastinating.</p>
                                                    <p>Making a mobile application with old-fashioned software is not good.</p>
                                                    <p>I am proud about my app.</p>
                                                    <p>The project taught me that creativity is a huge part of creating applications.</p>

                                                    <h2>Project 4.0 explanation</h2>
                                                    <p>This is a group-project where all of IT-Factory come together to create something for a client.</p>
                                                    <p>This project checks if the student has the skill of working in a group to effectively give a good solution to the customer.</p>
                                                    <p>There are 2 phases to each project: ideation and realization.</p>
                                                    <br>
                                                    <h2>Ideation phase</h2>
                                                    <p>During this phase, each group has to analyse the project (Who, what and why).</p>
                                                    <p>So, a group has to analyze who the project is for, what they need to create and why its necessary.</p>
                                                    <p>After a group analyzed those items, they will analyze how they will tackle the project.</p>
                                                    <p>In this phase, I was lead of my group and I made sure that the morale was good and the items analyzed would be correct.</p>
                                                    <p>Our client was 3-IT and they wanted an easier way to read data from a digital meter. They would like it if the user sees graphs depending on the consumption or production of energy.</p>
                                                    <p>My other job was, same as the rest of my teammates, to research something that would help us create a working project. Each team member needed to research whatever was in their field, which was AI for me.</p>
                                                    <p>I searched high and low for a good visualization software that could show the user some very informative and easy to understand graphs.</p>
                                                    <br>
                                                    <h2>Realization phase</h2>
                                                    <p>In this phase, we needed to build the site.</p>
                                                    <p>I first tried working with Qlik to make good visualizations, but I couldn't move those visualizations to the site automatically without paying for it.</p>
                                                    <p>Because Qlik didn't work, I tried to use PowerBi. Sadly enough, this ended up with the same result as Qlik.</p>
                                                    <p>Tension in the team was getting higher, so I communicated with our leader to maybe use a javascript plugin. He agreed and I helped design the graphs.</p>
                                                    <p>In the end, we had a pretty good site with alot of information regarding consumption and production of energy. You can watch the video of our working project down below.</p>

                                                    <h2>Data science explained</h2>
                                                    <p>Data science is a combination of maths and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics, AI and machine learning.</p>
                                                    <p>Data science is the science of uncovering actionable insights hidden in an organization's data.</p>
                                                    <p>These insights can be used to guide decision making and strategic planning.</p>
                                                    <p>This means that you can gather insight of a certain subject to create useful information for your organization. </p>
                                                    <p>There are many programs that you can use to work on data science, but we used something called R.</p>
                                                    <p>R is used to create graphs from data.</p>
                                                    <p>This was a group project and every member had the same responsibility.</p>
                                                    <br>
                                                    <h2>Analyzing Titanic dataset</h2>
                                                    <p>The first step of using data science on data surrounding the Titanic, was finding a dataset about this topic.</p>
                                                    <p>Next, we needed to check what data was in the dataset.</p>
                                                    <p>Afterwards, we were thinking what data to use for our project.</p>
                                                    <p>After that was done, we started building our graphs depending on the data.</p>
                                                    <p>Next, we added comments to our code for convenience and understanding it.</p>
                                                    <p>Finally we chose some graphs for our presentation.</p>
                                                    <p>Below, you can find our documentation about this dataset.</p>

                                                    <h2>What is big data</h2>
                                                    <p>Big data is data that contains greater variety, arriving in increased volume and with more velocity.</p>
                                                    <p>This basically means creating enormous data sets.</p>
                                                    <p>Big data was a group project. Every member had the same responsibilities.</p>
                                                    <br>
                                                    <h2>Categorizing tanks</h2>
                                                    <p>The reason we chose different types of tanks was because of all the different wars involving them.</p>
                                                    <p>The original plan was to detect an enemy tank, but this caused problems. The biggest problem was that it was near impossible to check which tank was the enemy (it could be that a Russian tank has a different faction controlling it).</p>
                                                    <p>In the end we wanted to see if we could create a program that detects what tank is shown.</p>
                                                    <p>The first step was gathering images of tanks. We did this by using: frames of videos and an image scraper.</p>
                                                    <p>Next, we needed to clean the data. This means that we only need images of tanks, so images of a tank that is far away, but a shrubbery is near, needs to be cleaned so that the tank is more clearly visible.</p>
                                                    <p>After all the cleaning was done, we started training our model using the images.</p>
                                                    <p>When the training was done, we built a Streamlit application to visualize detecting the tank category.</p>
                                                    <p>Finally, we tested our model against Google Teachable Machine to see if we did it better, and the heavy weight model did.</p>
